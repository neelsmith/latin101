Welcome to Latin 101!

I'm looking forward to meeting all of you at our first Zoom on Wednesday.

The web site for our section of Latin 101 is https://neelsmith.github.io/latin101/ -- you'll find all our course material there.

I've posted a short assignment for you to prepare before Wednesday.  You can go directly to it here:  https://neelsmith.github.io/latin101/assignments/intro/  As will often be the case, it falls into two parts: background and preparation, followed by an assignment to complete for credit.  (Wednesday's assignment is a very straightforward form to fill out, but do note that you'll need to do the background preparation *before* filling out the form!)

Valete!  (literally, "Be well," a good way to say, "See you later" in Latin)
