# Demonstrative and intensive pronouns

A group of very common adjectives (*is, ea, id*, "this; he, she, it"; *hic, haec, hoc*, "this"; *ille, illa, illud*, "that", and *ipse, ipsa, ipsum*, "the very one, him/her/itself") are regularly used as pronouns.  This is not really any different from the *substantive* use of adjectives we have seen on Roman coins, for example.  We saw the adjective *divus, diva, divum*, "deified", used as a regular adjective, as in *diva Faustina*, "the deified Faustina", but also as a substantive,  as in *divi filius*, "the son of the deified one".

(How common are they?  Forms of *ipse* occur 64 times in Hyginus, *ille* 91 times, and *is* 470 times! You *will* be rewarded for learning these forms when you can recognize them in your reading.)

## Memorization

Learn the irregular forms of these common pronouns.  [Full paradigms are included in the reference section of the L3 textbook](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/reference/pronouns-paradigms/).
