**Before you start reading**

These passages of Hyginus are taken from sections devoted to the life of Hercules.  He is in fact the subject of all the verbs in these selections!  What person and number do you expect the verbs to be?

- Person: [1, 2, 3]
- Number: [S, P]


## Passages

In the following passages, find each *clause*.  (Remember that in Latin, the verb *to be* might be implied only in a linking construction!)

For each clause, identify:

- nominative subject
- verb form (PNTMV)
- whether the verb is *transitive*, *intransitive* or a *linking verb*
- if the verb is a *transitive* verb in the *active* voice, does it have a direct object?
- if the verb is a *linking verb*, what is the predicate? (also in nominative case)


**Passage 1** (section 30)

> Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius interfecit; equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.


**Passage 2** (section 30)


> canem Cerberum Typhonis filium in conspectum adduxit.


**Passage 3** (section 32)


> Hercules ob id in seruitutem datus est.
