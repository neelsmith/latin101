# Nouns, part 2: self-correcting exercise

The following sentences are taken from Hyginus.  Try to complete at least the first two parts (**Identifying forms** and **Changing forms**) before you come to class.  We'll look at the third part (**What is the *function* of the word?**) together in class.

There is a parallel self-correcting exercise in the “Quiz” section of Moodle for our section. Take it as many times as you need during unit 1 to complete it for credit as one of your self-correcting exercises.


## Identifying forms

For all nouns marked <span class="idthis">like this</span>, fully identify the form (gender, case, number).

In addition to your assigned vocabulary, use the voculary list following the sentences.


1. Lynceus <span class="idthis">clipeum</span> Abanti <span class="idthis">filio</span> dedit.

2. fecit Hercules <span class="idthis">gymnicos</span> Pelopi Tantali <span class="idthis">filio</span>.

3. Lemniades Hypsipylen <span class="idthis">regi</span> Lyco in <span class="idthis">seruitutem</span> uendiderunt.

4. Apollo <span class="idthis">filios</span> eius interfecit.

5. Agaue Cadmi <span class="idthis">filia</span> <span class="idthis">regem</span> interfecit et <span class="idthis">patri</span> suo <span class="idthis">regnum</span> dedit.

6. Metapontus duxit <span class="idthis">coniugio</span> Melanippen,  <span class="idthis">filios</span>-que adoptauit.

7. Latinus ex suo <span class="idthis">nomine</span> Latinae <span class="idthis">linguae</span> <span class="idthis">nomen</span> imposuit


**Additional vocabulary**:

- clipeus, clipei, *masculine*, "shield"
- gymnicus, gymnici, *masculine*, in plural, "athletic games"
- lingua, linguae, *feminine*, "language"
- regnum, regni, *neuter*, "kingdom"
- seruitus, seruitutis, *feminine*, "slavery"


## Changing forms

For each of the nouns in the sentence above, change the *number*  (if it is singular, change to plural; if it is plural, change to singular), but *keep the case the same*.

Example: *filus* is masculine, nominative, **singular**: change to masculine nominative **plural** = *filii*.


## What is the *function* of the word?

For each noun you identified, we will go over in class *why*  the noun is in a particular case, and what that means.

Recall that we use the *nominative* case to *name the subject*;  the *accusative* case is the "target" case that we use for the direct object; the *dative* case is the "winners/losers" case that can include ideas like indirect object; and the *genitive* case connects two nouns together.

Here are the verb forms used in the examples above.

- *adoptauit* : "h/she adopted"
- *dedit* : "h/she gave"
- *fecit* : "h/she made"
- *imposuit*: literally, "h/she placed [one thing, direct object] upon [another, indirect object]"
- *interfecit* : "h/she killed"
- *uendiderunt*:  "they sold"
