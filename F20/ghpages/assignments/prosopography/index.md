# Identify that character!


## Background and goals

The stories in Hyginus' *Fabulae* name hundreds of gods and humans.  Through the course of the year, we will collectively compile a guide to those figures -- a kind of on-line mythological encyclopedia.

We will exploit your new knowledge of Latin nouns to identify the nominative and genitive form for each name.  This will let us algorithmically parse and identify *any* form of that name in Hyginus -- or any other citable Latin text.  Our online lexicon will include an automatically constructed index for each name that links to a full on-line text of Hyginus.  

Your name will appear on each of your contributions in this collaborative work. We will add our lexicon to resources for the *Lingua Latina Legenda* project, where it will also be easily searchable.


## Instructions

You will be assigned two characters. For each character, you will be given a list of one or more forms of the character's name that actually appear in the text of Hyginus.  Your job is:

- figure out the nominative and genitive singular of each figure
- find out if the character is covered in the *Latin Dictionary* by Lewis and Short, using [this online edition from Furman University](http://folio2.furman.edu/lewis-short/)
- compose a one-paragraph summary about the character



### Nominative and genitive singular

As you know from class, the nominative and genitive singular togther tell us what declension a noun belongs to. When you think you have figured out the proper forms for your character, you can always check against the [paradigms from the *Lingua Latina Legenda* textbook](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/reference/nouns-paradigms/) -- do *all* of the forms of your name work in the declension you picked?

### Summary paragraph

Use wikipedia or any other resources available to you to find out about your character.  Please cite any source(s) you use.  If you refer to ancient texts, please cite using *canonical references* (such as the section number of Hyginus), not page numbers.  You may use *markdown* to include links in your one-paragraph summary.  (If you're not familiar with markdown, here is [everything you need to know](https://www.remarq.io/articles/five-minutes-to-markdown-mastery/) in one-page that you can read in 5 minutes.)
