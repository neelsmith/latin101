## Self-corrected assignment

Please answer the questions about the following sentence which include gerunds or infinitives.  You can test yourself using [this interactive page](https://observablehq.com/@neelsmith/lingua-latina-legenda-unit-2-analyze-sentences-using-gerun?collection=@neelsmith/l3)

>  **NB**: All but the first of these sentences comes from Hyginus.   Note that in our  edition of Hyginus, there is no distinction of *u/v*:  for example, *necauit* is the same form that you would see as *necavit* in a text that made those distinctions.
