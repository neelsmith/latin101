# Forming the perfect and pluperfect subjunctive


In class, we will:

1. read about [the formation of the *perfect* and *pluperfect* tenses of the subjunctive](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/07-subjunctive/) in the L3 textbook
2. find the *present* and *imperfect* forms of the verb *sum, esse, fui, futurus*, "to be," in [this page of charts](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/reference/irregular-verbs-paradigms/)


Questions for small groups:

- review usage of principal parts:
  - what principal part do we use for the *perfect active*?
  - what principal part do we use for the *perfect passive*?
  - what principal part do we use for the *pluperfect active*?
  - what principal part do we use for the *pluperfect passive*?
- regular and irregular verb forms:  
  - what subjunctive tense/voice combination directly uses forms of the *present subjunctive* of *sum*?
  - what subjunctive tense/voice combination directly uses forms of the *imperfect subjunctive* of *sum*?
  - what subjunctive active forms of *sum* are completely regular?
