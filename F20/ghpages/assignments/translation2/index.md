# Translation 2


## Guide for reading

You do not need to write out your answers to questions in this guide: these questions are to help you analyze any passage of Latin you approach for the first time.

### Step 1: focus on the verb

- find the verb of each clause
- what kind of clause is it?  
    - if *linking* clause, look for *nominative subject* and *nominative predicate*
    - if *intransitive*, check for *nominative subject*
    - if *transitive*, what voice is the verb?
        - if *passive*, look for *nominative subject* matching the fourth principle part (perfect passive participle) in gender and number
        - if *active*, check for *nominative subject* and *accusative direct object*

### Step 2: review remaining nouns

- after you have found any possible subjects and (for transitive active verbs) direct objects, are there any remaining nouns?
- what case are they in?  (This is our guide to their function.)

Further uses of cases we have seen:

- genitive case to *describe another noun*
- dative case for the *winner/loser* of the action (e.g., indirect object)
- ablative or other cases with specific prepositions

## Concepts to review

- imperfect indicate, active and passive
- perfect indicative active and passive
- prepositions
- use of *a/ab* ("by") to express *agent* of passive verb

## Vocabulary for reference


- *olim* - long ago
- *Prometheus*, *Prometheī*, m. - Prometheus
- *Iapetus*, *Iapetī*, m. - Iapetus
- *lutum*, *lutī*, n. - mud
- *fingō*, *fingere, finxī, fictus* - to fashion
- *simul* - at the same time
- *Vulcānus*, *Vulcānī*, m. - Vulcan
- *Minerva*, *Minervae*, f. - Minerva
- *anima*, *animae*, f. - soul, spirit
- *deus*, *deī*, m. - god
- *dōnum*, *dōnī*, n. - gift
- *Iūppiter*, *Iovis*, m. - Jupiter / Jove
- *Epimetheus*, *Epimetheī*, m. - Epimetheus
- *mortālis*, *mortāle* - mortal
