# Introduction to Unit 2

> Introductory video TBA

In Unit 1, you learned

- how the *case of nouns* indicates their function in a clause
- how to use the *four principal parts of verbs* to express both active and passive voice forms of the imperfect and perfect indicative
- how to recognize clauses and classify. Basic patterns you encountered included clauses with:
    - subject, direct object,  and verb (and possibly an indirect object as well) in *transitive - active* clauses
    - subject, verb (and possibly an expression of *agent*) in  *transitive - passive*
    - subject and verb in *intransitive* clauses
    - subject and predicate in *linking* clauses

In Unit 2, we will enrich these sentences with phrases expressing time, place and purpose.





## Review

- in the L3 textbook, read about [prepositional phrases](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/03-place-and-time/#prepositional-phrases)


## New material

In the L3 textbook:

- read about [expressions of place and time](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/03-place-and-time/#expressions-of-place)
