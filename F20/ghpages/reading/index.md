# Reading a Latin text

We will expand this guide as we become familiar with a wider range of Latin syntax, but the steps in the basic approach will not change.

### Step 1: focus on the verb

- find the verb of each clause
- what kind of clause is it?  
    - if *linking* clause, look for *nominative subject* and *nominative predicate*
    - if *intransitive*, check for *nominative subject*
    - if *transitive*, what voice is the verb?
        - if *passive*, look for *nominative subject* matching the fourth principle part (perfect passive participle) in gender and number.  Is an agent expressed (with the preposition *a/ab*)?
        - if *active*, check for *nominative subject* and *accusative direct object*

### Step 2: review remaining nouns

- after you have found any possible subjects,  direct objects (for transitive active verbs) or agents with *a/ab* (with transitive passive verbs), are there any remaining nouns?
- what case are they in?  (This is our guide to their function.)

Some important uses of cases we have seen:

- genitive case to *describe another noun*
- dative case for the *winner/loser* of the action (e.g., indirect object)
- ablative or other cases with *specific prepositions*
- ablative or accusative case in expressions of time

If the noun is modified by a *gerundive*, does it express purpose?
