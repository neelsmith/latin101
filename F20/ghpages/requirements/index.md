# Course requirements and grading

Course grades will be determined by specification grading.  Individual assignments are graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale according to a previously shared rubric. One aim of specification grading is to give you control over your grades. Grades are not arbitrarily assigned â€“ they are earned by the work that you do. You can decide how much time and energy you want to commit to earn the grade you desire.

- self-correcting exercises
