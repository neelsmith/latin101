### Nouns


#### First declension

*Argonauta* is an example of a masculine noun of the first declension.

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| Nominative | Argonaut-<span class="attention">a</span> |  Argonaut-<span class="attention">ae</span> |
| Genitive | Argonaut-<span class="attention">ae</span> |  Argonaut-<span class="regular">arum</span> |
| Dative | Argonaut-<span class="attention">ae</span> | Argonaut-<span class="regular">is</span> |
| Accusative | Argonaut-<span class="regular">am</span> | Argonaut-<span class="regular">as</span> |
| Ablative | Argonaut-<span class="attention">ā</span> | Argonaut-<span class="regular">is</span> |

#### Second declension

*filius* is an example of a second-declension masculine noun in *-us*.

You should also be able to decline masculine second-declension nouns like *puer, pueri* and neuter second-declension nouns like *exemplum, exempli*.


| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| Nominative | fili-<span class="regular">us</span> | fili-<span class="regular">i</span> |
| Genitive | fili-<span class="regular">i</span> | fili-<span class="regular">orum</span> |
| Dative | fili-<span class="regular">o</span> | fili-<span class="regular">is</span> |
| Accusative | fili-<span class="regular">um</span> | fili-<span class="regular">os</span> |
| Ablative | fili-<span class="regular">o</span> | fili-<span class="regular">is</span> |

#### Third declension



*mater, matris* is an example of a third-declension feminine noun.  Notice the distinct forms of dative and ablative singular.

You should also be able to decline neuter third-declension nouns like *nomen, nominis*.


| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| Nominative | mater | matr-<span class="regular">es</span> |
| Genitive | matri-<span class="regular">is</span> | matr-<span class="attention">um</span> |
| Dative | matr-<span class="attention">i</span> | matri-<span class="regular">ibus</span> |
| Accusative | matr-<span class="regular">em</span> | matr-<span class="regular">es</span> |
| Ablative |  matr-<span class="attention">e</span> | matr-<span class="regular">ibus</span> |

*i-stem*

*urbs, urbis* is an example of a third-declension i-stem.  

You should also be able to decline neuter i-stems like *mare, maris* (with nominative/accusative plural mar-<span class="attention">ia</span>).

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| Nominative | urbs | urb-<span class="regular">es</span> |
| Genitive | urb-<span class="regular">is</span> | urb-<span class="attention">ium</span> |
| Dative |  urb-<span class="attention">i</span> |  urb-<span class="regular">ibus</span> |
| Accusative |  urb-<span class="regular">em</span> | urb-<span class="regular">e</span> |
| Ablative | urb-<span class="attention">e</span> | urb-<span class="regular">ibus</span>  |


### Adjectives

Adjectives use the same endings you know from nouns.


#### Third-declension adjectives.


*acer, acris, acre* is a third declension adjective with *three* terminations.  Notice that its endings look like the endings of third-declension *i-stem* nouns, and pay special attention to the ending of the ablative singular.

You should also understand how to use these endings in third declension nouns with *two* terminations (masculine and feminine forms identical), or *one* termination (all three genders use identical forms).

#### 2-1-2 adjectives

2-1-2 adjectives use *second* declension endings for masculine and neuter forms, and *first* declension endings for feminine forms, so in this table listing forms in the traditional order masculine, feminine, neuter, the columns will be 2nd-1st-2nd declensions.


**Singular**

The plural is identical to regular 2-1-2 adjectives.

### Verbs

Third person indicative forms of imperfect and perfect tenses.  Note that the endings are identical; the vowel of the stem depends on the conjugation.

#### Imperfect indicative, third person singular


| **Conjugation** | **Active** | **Passive** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st| seru<span class="attention">a</span>-<span class="regular">bat</span>  | seru<span class="attention">a</span>-<span class="regular">bat**ur**</span> |
