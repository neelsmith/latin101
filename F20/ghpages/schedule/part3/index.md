# Unit 3: subordination

## Background

In Unit 1, you learned how Latin nouns, adjectives and verbs change form.  In Unit 2, you learned how to use the verbal noun (the *gerund*) and verbal adjective (the *gerundive*) to express purpose, and extended your knowledge of Latin tenses to present and future time.

In Unit 3 you will be introduced to *subordinate* clauses:  clauses with a subject and verb that can not stand on their own,.
