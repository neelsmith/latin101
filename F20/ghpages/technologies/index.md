ZOoming

You may have considerations that will prevent you from keeping your camera on during our synchronous meetings, including internet speed or access issues, family responsibilities, or personal discomfort, so you may absolutely leave your camera off if you want or need to do so. To the extent that you are comfortable and able to turn your camera on, though, please feel free to do so (and be mindful of what’s within your camera’s view or which virtual background you’re using!). This will help us to create a sense of connection and community in our class and encourage engagement with and trust in one another.</p>

<p>(More thoughts on the pros and cons of keeping cameras on can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zpqWp74RAxFPWR_0eF-VV_400-Z-jTFa/view">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Please try, however, to mute your microphone unless you are actively speaking or would like to offer a thought or question. This is to ensure that we give due focus to whoever is speaking and to avoid being distracted by unintended background noise.</p>

<p>If Zoom goes haywire:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you're on a desktop or laptop and it seems like the problem is just you, try leaving the class and returning, or, if that doesn't work, try restarting your computer and returning to the meeting.</li>
  <li>If it seems like Zoom is going haywire on everybody, not just you, take a 5-minute break from your computer screen, enjoy some fresh air or a glass of water, then come back and check your email: I'll send you a link for a Google Meet meeting and we'll resume class on that platform.</li>
  <li>If Zoom breaks down for everyone in the last 10 minutes of a class period, just go enjoy the fresh air and a glass of water and I'll see you at the next class meeting




  <h4 id="student-hours">Student Hours</h4>
<p>Student hours are an opportunity for you to meet with me outside of class to discuss anything you’d like: questions about the readings, clarifications about lectures or assignments, even simply shooting the breeze. My student hours are times that I am sure to be in my Zoom meeting room, unless you’re notified otherwise, so I highly encourage you to take advantage of them! I’m also happy to make appointments outside of my regular student hours if they conflict with your availability; simply shoot me an e-mail with what times and dates work for you.</p>
