He was said to be the handsomest man among the Greeks before Troy. (Horace) Nīreus was among the admirers of Helen. Consequently, he joined in the campaign against Troy, leading the Achaeans. There are conflicts about his death. Some sources state that he didn’t excel in strength and was killed by Eurypylus, the son of Telephus, or Aeneas. Other sources state that he survived the Trojan War and landed in Libya with Thoas after getting caught in a storm that scattered the Greek ships. Later, it is said that he “sailed off to Argyrinoi and the Ceraunian Mountains, where he settled near Mount Lakmynion and River Aias."
