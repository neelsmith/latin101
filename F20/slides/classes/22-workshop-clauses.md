# Big ideas

May be:

- linking (*sum*)
- transitive verb (active or passive voice)
- intransitive verb (no direct object)

# Independent / dependent

Independent clauses ("main", "primary"):

- can stand alone as a complete sentence

Dependent clauses ("subordinate", "secondary"):

- include introductory word (e.g., a *subordinating conjunction*)
- not a complete sentence

---

# Compound/complex

- complex: has one or more dependent clauses
- compound: two or main clauses

---

# Example: Hyginus, 30.1

> **When** Hercules was a child,

he strangled two snakes sent by Juno, `and`

from this fact it was realized

> **that** Hercules was the firstborn.
