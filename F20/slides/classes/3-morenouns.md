# Latin prepositions



- ideas of space, and other *relations of a noun to the action of a sentence* (like English)
- *always* connected by (or *govern*) a specific case

# Examples

in mare

> in the ocean


Perdix Daedali sororis filius et circinum et serram ex piscis spina repperit

> Perdix, the one of Daedalus' daughter, invented both the compass and the saw *from the spine of a fish*

# Different meaning by case


in seruitute

> in slavery (a static state)

in seruitutem

> into slavery (a change of state)

# Describing nouns: English

- word order:

> *Labor* Day


- "genitive" case ("of")

> denial *of service*

Use all of them!

> **denial** *of service* attack
