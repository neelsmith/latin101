# Building a web site on github

Reminder:

- translation and composition assignments submitted on github
- host portfolio on public web site

---

# Prerequisites

- account on `github.com`


---


# Overview

1. Create a new repository
2. Modify "GitHub Pages" settings for the repository
3. Add content in *markdown* to the repository

---

# Two URLs

1. Your github repository:  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO
2. Your Web site:  https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO

---

# 1. Create  a new repository

- log into GitHub
- "create a new repository" page:
    - fill in a name (no spaces)
    - check *Public*
    - check *Initialize this repository with* / "Add a README file"



---

# 2. Modify settings


- Find settings (may be in three-dot menu if your window is narrow)
- *Options* tab: scroll to *GitHub Pages*:
    - **Source**: *master* branch, *docs* folder

---

#  3. Add content

Back at your repository main window:

- "Add file" menu, "Create new file"
- Use `docs/index.md` for file name
    - when you enter "/", github interprets it as separating a folder name (`docs`) from a file name (`index.md`)
- Type in a one-sentence summary
- "Commit changes"

---



# Check out your web site!

1. Your github repository:  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO
2. Your Web site:  https://USERNAME.github.com/REPO

---


# More about your web site

When you save a file with `.md` extension, github interprets the contents as *markdown*, a lightweight, plain-text format for structuring documents.
