# Sentence types

- Transitive
- Intransitive

---

# Transitive

- in active voice, verb can have direct object
- in passive voice, subject receives action of verb

In English, "make" is a transitive verb:

> I made a mistake.
> Mistakes were made.

---



# Intransitive

- verb cannot have a direct object

The English verb "travel" is intransitive:

> We cannot travel because of the pandemic.

---

# Examples

- "travel" is **intransitive**
- "visit" is **transitive**


> I travelled to Virginia, and visited my parents.


---

# Linking verbs

> A *linking verb* connects the **subject** with a another name or description of the subject, called the **predicate**.

- The English verb "to be" is a linking verb



---

# Linking sentences

> Hyginus is the author of the book

Hyginus == author, a *predicate noun*


> His book is interesting.

book == interesting, a *predicate adjective*


---

# Linking vs transitive sentences


> Hyginus wrote the book.

*book* == direct object, the target of the action *wrote*

> Hyginus is the author.

*author* is a predicate describing Hyginus: no one is acting on the author

# Linking sentences in Latin

- *subject* and *predicate noun* are both nominative

*Apollo deus est.*

> Apollo is a god.

- *deus* is nominative singular

- *Predicate adjectives* agree with the subject

*Apollo tristis est.*

> Apollo is sad.

- *tristis* agrees with *Apollo*: both are masculine, nominative, singular
