# Meeting each other

Break-out groups, two reporters to bring back to whole group:

1. one interesting fact to introduce each member of your group
2. suggest at least one way to form study groups outside of class

---


# Highlights from course site

- All assignments can be revised (up to unit deadline)
- CBL integral to course


---

# Studying Latin as a form of privilege

-  can convey real, transferable skills:
    - with languages
    - with cultural understanding
- but also can be gatekeeper to other privileges/power

**Vivamus vel libero perit Americae**

> ?? Letâ€™s live or s/he passes away from America for the detriment of a free man??

# Latin: what kind of authority?

Why a Latin motto?

Why not Spanish?  or Chinese?

> (Footnote: McDaniel: Latin gobbledy gook = Google Translate output!)

# Inflection vs. word order

---


# Is it news?

English expresses syntax by *word order*: **subject-verb-object** (SVO)

Not news:

> Dog bites man.

News:

> Man bites dog!

# Latin nouns: find declension from vocabulary entry

- second form is *genitive singular*:
- *ending* tells you *declension*

| Ending | Declension | Example |
| --- | ---  | --- |
| -**ae** | 1st | filia, fili**ae**, *f.*, "daughter" |
| -**i** | 2nd | filus, fili**i**, *m.*, "son" |
| -**is** | 3rd | homo, homin**is**, *m.*, "person" |


<style scoped>

  strong {
    color: rgb(159, 69, 17);
  }

# Accusative: the **target** case


| Declension | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | -*a***m** | -*a***s** |
| 2nd | -*u***m** | -*o***s** |
| 3rd | -*e***m** | -*e***s** |

# Latin expresses syntax by **form**

Not news:

> Dog bites man.
> Canis homin**em** mordet.
> Homin**em** canis mordet.

News:

> Man bites dog.
> Can**em** homo mordet.
> Homo can**em** mordet.

# Latin word order is *not* random!

A frequent pattern:

- subject-object-verb (SOV) **canis hominem mordet**.

Other possibilities:

- object-subject-verb (OSV) **hominem canis mordet**.
- verb-object-subject (VOS) **mordet hominem canis**.

# What does it mean?


- less common patterns *always* call your attention to something less expected
- slight difference in emphasis?
