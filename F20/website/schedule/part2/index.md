In Unit 1, you learned

- how the *case of nouns* indicates their function in a clause
- how to use the *four principal parts of verbs* to express both active and passive voice forms of the imperfect and perfect indicative
- how to recognize clauses and classify. Basic patterns you encountered included clauses with:
    - subject, direct object,  and verb (and possibly an indirect object as well) in *transitive - active* clauses
    - subject, verb (and possibly an expression of *agent*) in  *transitive - passive*
    - subject and verb in *intransitive* clauses
    - subject and predicate in *linking* clauses

In Unit 2, we will enrich these sentences with phrases expressing time, place and purpose.





## Review

- in the Unit 1 required vocabulary list, review prepositions and the cases they take
- in the L3 textbook, read about [prepositional phrases](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/03-place-and-time/#prepositional-phrases)


## New material

In the L3 textbook:

- read about [expressions of place and time](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/03-place-and-time/#expressions-of-place)


## Goals

You will read simple Latin sentences in all persons and voices of the present, imperfect and perfect indicative, including expressions of time and place with the accusative and ablative cases, and expressions of purpose with the gerundive.

## Objectives

- identify all forms of the gerundive
- identify expressions of time using the accusative and ablative cases
- identify all persons of the present, imperfect and perfect indicative in both active and passive voices
- use principal parts to form present, imperfect and perfect forms of verbs
