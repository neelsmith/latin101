Antaeum, terrae filium, in Libyā Hercules occidit. hic hospites interficiebat; hunc luctando ille necauit. Cygnum, Martis filium, armis occidit. Mars uenit et armis propter filium contendit cum eo, sed Iouis inter eos fulmen misit. ceto Hesione apposita est Troiae. eum occidit; Laomedonta, patrem Hesiones, quod eam non reddebat, sagittis interfecit.
