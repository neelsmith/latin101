# Adjectives: self-correcting exercise

## Background

These coins do not distinguish *I* from *J*, or *U* from *V*.  A name that you might see spelled *Julia* in a printed edition of a Latin text will be spelled **IVLIA** on these coins, for example.

Names are also nouns, with forms you can identify by gender, case and number. (In fact, the Latin word *nomen* means both "name" and "noun", and is the source for the English word "noun.")


## 1. Recognizing names

Latin dictionaries may not include every name you encounter in your reading, but you can often work out from context what form a name is.  In this section, recall that when Roman imperial coins depict a member of the imperial family, they most frequently *name* the  person in the *nominative* case.  Identify the nominative singular and what you think the genitive singular would be for the following four figures.

(You can follow the links to wikipedia articles to learn more about each figure.)

###  A. Faustina

[Faustina the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faustina_the_Elder) was the niece of the emperor Hadrian, aunt of the later emperor Marcus Aurelius, and wife of the emperor Antoninus Pius.  After her early death, he often commemorated her on coins.

## 2. Multiple cases in the text on coins

In addition to labelling figures using the *nominative* case, coins sometimes link a noun in the *dative* case to an illustration.  In these coins, the text is a kind of dedication, and especially a dedication to a divinity: the illustrated coin is *for* someone.  This gold coin was issued by the emperor Hadrian to commemorate his father, Trajan, who was deified after his death.  (The 2-1-2 adjective *divus*, *divus*, *divum* means "deified".)


### A. Trajan

[Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan) was born in Spain (near modern Seville), and ruled over the Roman Empire's widest geographic expansion.  During his lifetime, the Senate named him "Best Emperor Ever!" (in Latin, *optimus princeps*).

**DIVO TRAIANO PATRI**


On this coin, you have extra help sorting out the form of Trajan's name, because he is also decribed with a an adjective (**DIVO**) and a noun you already know (**PATRI**).  Since they all describe the same person, they must all be in the same gender, case and number.

1. What is the gender, case and number of all three words in this short text?

1. Suggest a genitive singular of this name:

## F. Vespasian

[Vespasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian) emerged as the survivor in a civil war in 68-69 CE that saw four emperors come and go in a year.  He was the first emperor who was not born into a family of senatorial class.  He was probably best known for brutally suppressing a rebellion in the province of Judaea, including the destruction of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.

On this coin, the abbreviation **SC** means "by decree of the Senate," a formula regularly used on coins of this denominiation, the sestertius, which were paid for by fund controlled by the Senate.  (We'll look at the grammar of this expression a little later this semester.)
