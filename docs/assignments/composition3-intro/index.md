# Introduction to composition 3

In today's class, we will introduce your third Latin composition.  

Instead of preparing a new assignment, review:

- use of the gerundive to express purpose and necessity
- use of the infinitive as a noun form
- expressing agent with the passive voice:
    - *a/ab* + ablative with finite verbs
    - dative case with the gerundive
- recognizing verbs indicative and subjunctive verbs in the present and imperfect, and indicative verbs in the perfect tense.  You can practice with timed exercises in [self-correcting notebook](https://observablehq.com/@neelsmith/lingua-latina-legena-unit-3-speed-test-on-verb-identificati?collection=@neelsmith/l3)
