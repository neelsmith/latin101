# Composition 3: Venus and Mars

## Background  story

> Venus was sleeping with Mars secretly, and Vulcan wanted to expose them. So, he created an adamant chain and put it around the bed to catch Mars with cleverness. The next time they slept together, Venus and Mars were trapped in the bed and weren’t able to escape. All the gods were summoned and saw them. So, Mars became ashamed.
