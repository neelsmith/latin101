# Composition 4: Hercules and Megara


## Background story

> After Hercules had been sent by King Eurystheus to fight Cerberus, the three-headed dog, Lycus, the son of Neptune, thought that he [Hercules] had died. As a result, Lycus wished to kill Megara, the daughter of Creon and Hercules’ wife, and their sons, Therimachus and Ophis, and take his kingdom. After he had heard this, Hercules quickly went to Lycus and killed him. Because of his evil deed, Hercules was punished by Juno, the wife of Jupiter. The goddess possessed his mind and Hercules killed Megara and his sons. In the aftermath of this event, Hercules did not wish to live and subsequently was given into slavery by Mercury.
