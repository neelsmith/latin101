## Memorization

Memorize third person indicative forms of the imperfect and perfect tenses.  Note that the endings are identical; the vowel of the stem depends on the conjugation.

#### Imperfect indicative, third person singular


| **Conjugation** | **Active** | **Passive** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st| seru<span class="attention">a</span>-<span class="regular">bat</span>  | seru<span class="attention">a</span>-<span class="regular">bat**ur**</span> |
| 2nd | hab<span class="attention">e</span>-<span class="regular">bat</span>  | hab<span class="attention">e</span>-<span class="regular">bat**ur**</span> |
| 3rd | duc<span class="attention">e</span>-<span class="regular">bat</span> |  duc<span class="attention">e</span>-<span class="regular">bat**ur**</span> |
| 3rd-io | fac<span class="attention">ie</span>-<span class="regular">bat</span> |  fac<span class="attention">ie</span>-<span class="regular">bat**ur**</span> |
| 4th | aud<span class="attention">ie</span>-<span class="regular">bat</span> |  aud<span class="attention">ie</span>-<span class="regular">bat**ur**</span> |


#### Imperfect indicative, third person plural

| **Conjugation** | **Active** | **Passive** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st| serua-<span class="regular">bant</span>  | serua-<span class="regular">bant**ur**</span> |
| 2nd | habe-<span class="regular">bant</span>  | habe-<span class="regular">bant**ur**</span> |
| 3rd | duce-<span class="regular">bant</span> |  duce-<span class="regular">bant**ur**</span> |
| 3rd-io | facie-<span class="regular">bant</span> |  facie-<span class="regular">bant**ur**</span> |
| 4th | audie-<span class="regular">bant</span> |  audie-<span class="regular">bant**ur**</span> |

#### Perfect indicative

(All conjugations work identically)

**Active**:

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| seruau-<span class="regular">it</span> | seruau-<span class="regular">ērunt</span> *or* seruau-<span class="regular">ēre</span> |

The passive is formed with the present tense of "to be" plus the fourth-part adjective. The adjective form will always be nominative, and will also agree in case and number with the subject.

**Singular**:

| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| seruat-<span class="regular">us est</span>  | seruat-<span class="regular">a est</span>  | seruat-<span class="regular">um est</span>  |


**Plural**:

| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| seruat-<span class="regular">i sunt</span>  | seruat-<span class="regular">ae sunt</span>  | seruat-<span class="regular">a sunt</span>  |
