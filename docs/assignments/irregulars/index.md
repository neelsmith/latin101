# Two important irregular verbs: *fero* and *eo*


Use [this page of irregular verbs](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/reference/irregular-verbs-paradigms/) to find where the two important verbs *fero*, "to carry," and *eo*, "to go," are **irregular**.


- find and memorize their *four principal parts*

Note the following regular patterns:

> All forms in the perfect system are built from the third and fourth principal parts in entirely *regular* patterns
>
> The *imperfect subjunctive*  forms look like adding endings to the present infinitive -- just like regular verbs
>
> The *pluperfect subjunctive*  orms look like adding endings to the perfect infintive -- just like regular verbs

Find the irregularities in:

- their *forms* in the *present active indicative*
- their *stem* in the *imperfect active indicative*
- their *stem* in the *present active subjunctive*
