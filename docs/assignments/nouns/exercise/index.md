# Nouns: self-correcting exercise

## Background

You know enough Latin to read and interpret the messages on many Roman imperial coins.  These texts are all short enough to fit in a tweet, and convey carefully composed statements about the emperor's authority and policies.

## Assignment

1. Using your knowledge of Latin nouns, plus the vocabulary list below, answer the questions about these coins. You should complete at least the questions about the first four illustrations before coming to class.
2. There is a parallel self-correcting exercise in the "Quiz" section of Moodle for our section.  Take it as many times as you need during unit 1 to complete it for credit as one of your self-correcting exercises.

## Supplementary vocabulary for this assignment

In addition to vocabulary you have memorized, you will need to be able to look up new vocabulary when you're reading Latin.  Refer to this vocabulary list for new vocabulary you will need memorize this semester:

- Two imperial names that were also used as titles:
    - Augustus, -i, *m* - "Augustus"; and Augusta, -ae, *f* - "Augustus" or "Augusta"
    - Caesar, Caesaris, *m* - "Caesar"
- An adjective (that we'll learn about next time) used as a noun:
    - divus, -i, *m* -  "(a/the) deified one"
- Five  nouns:
    - iuventus, iuventutis, *f* - "youth" (collective), "young persons"
    - patria, -ae, *f* - "homeland, fatherland"
    - populus, -i, *m* - "the people" (collective)
    - princeps, principis, *m* - "leader, head"
    - victoria, -ae, *f* - "victory"

Illustration 2, a gold coin of Gaius Caesar (Caligula).

- what case is *mater* ?
- what case is *caesaris* ?

Ilustration 1, a silver coin from the period of the Civil Wars:

- Find one noun in the nominative case
- Find one noun in the genitive case
- What do you think the personified figure on this coin represents?

Illustration 2, a silver coin of Constantine.  *Siscia* is the name of the city where the coin was minted.  

- What case is *Victoria* ?
- What case and number is *Caesarum* ?
- What similarities do you observe between the personified figure on this coin, and the figure in Illustration 1, struck almost three centuries earlier?


Illustration 3, a gold coin of Augustus:

- Figure out the case of every noun on this coin.
- Which two words in this Latin text were adopted by classically minded Americans to describe George Washington?


Illustration 4, the reverse of the same coin.  The phrase *consules designati* means "appointed to be the next consuls," the highest office in the Roman Empire.  We'll look at the grammar of that phrase later.

- What case and number is *Caesares*?
- What case and number is *Gaius* and *Lucius*?
- As you can see from your vocabulary list, *iuventutis* must be in the genitive case.  What noun does it connect to or describe?
