# The verb *possum* to be able



## Review from previous classes

- Review third-person forms of *sum*, "to be," and know its principle parts *sum*, *esse*, *fui*, *futurus*.
- Remember that *sum* is a *linking* verb.  When *sum* is the main verb of a clause, you should look for a predicate in nominative case.
- How can you distinguish between a clause with *sum* used as the main verb of the clause, and a clause with a form in the *perfect passive* tense?
- *possum* usually occurs with a complementary infinitive.  When a  form of *possum* is the main verb of a clause, look for an infinitive that works with it.


## *possum*

Memorize the  principle parts *possum*, *posse*, *potui*, --, and the third-person forms of *possum*, "to be able," listed below.

| Imperfect | *pot`erat`* | *pot`erant`* |

## Forming infinitives

Infinitives are *nouns* naming the action of the verb.  The infinitive is neuter gender and singular in number. *amāre* (the second principle part of *amo*) means "the act of loving" or "to love."  

But unlike other nouns, infinitives also have *voice* and *tense*.   We're concerned with two tenses of the infinitive, the *present* and the *perfect*.  They emphasize a difference in the aspect or time of the action:  the present infinitive refers to ongoing or incomplete actions, the perfect infinitive refers to previously completed actions.

We use the same principle parts to form infinitives that we use for finite verb forms: second parts for the present system both active and passive voices, third part for the perfect active, and fourth part for the perfect passive.   Today, we'll use the second part to create the present infinitive in both active and passive voices.  The second part already gives you the active voice. To form the present passive infinitive, change the final *-e* of the active infinitive to *i*, e.g.,  *amare* -> *amari*, *audire* -> *audiri*.


Consider these examples of the present infinitive, used as the subject of a sentence..


> Amāre bonum est .

"To love is good."

"Loving is a good thing."

> Amāri bonum est.

"To be loved  is good."

"Being loved is a good thing."
