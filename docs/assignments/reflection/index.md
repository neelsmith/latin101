## Final reflection


Please add to your github repository before the end of exam period a file named `reflection.md`, with a brief reflective essay (1-2 pages, or 300-500 words) on your experience in Latin 101 this semester.  Your essay should take into account both what we have done in our CBL work, and what we have done in our MWF class.

Your reflection should consider what you have learned about the intersection of Latin and structures of power, and how this relates to larger attempts to create a more just society. You could refer specifically to our discussions of gender and pronouns, how the passive voice and attributions of agency relate to power, the limited access of classics to students of color, and the “dark side of the subjunctive,”  and more generally could discuss any ways your exposure to Latin this semester has given you a different perspective on language or specifically on English.
