# Forming the perfect and pluperfect subjunctive


In class, we will:

1. read about [the formation of the *perfect* and *pluperfect* tenses of the subjunctive](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/07-subjunctive/) in the L3 textbook
2. find the *present* and *imperfect* forms of the verb *sum, esse, fui, futurus*, "to be," in [this page of charts](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/reference/irregular-verbs-paradigms/)


Questions for small groups:

- review usage of principal parts:
  - what principal part do we use for the *perfect active*?
  - what principal part do we use for the *perfect passive*?
  - what principal part do we use for the *pluperfect active*?
  - what principal part do we use for the *pluperfect passive*?
- regular and irregular verb forms:  
  - what subjunctive tense/voice combination directly uses forms of the *present subjunctive* of *sum*?
  - what subjunctive tense/voice combination directly uses forms of the *imperfect subjunctive* of *sum*?
  - what subjunctive active forms of *sum* are completely regular?

## Exercise

Identify the tense and voice of the highlighted subjunctive form.  If the form is perfect passive or pluperfect passive, identify the gender of the subject as well.

Once you have a correct answer, break the form down:

- what principal part is it built on?  
- what is the stem?
- what is the subjunctive ending?

**Example**:  given ***<span class="highlight">amet</span>***, you correctly identify it as **present active**. Analysis:

- second principle part (*amƒÅre*)
- stem *am-*
- ending *-et*
