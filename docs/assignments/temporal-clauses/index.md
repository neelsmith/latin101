# Temporal clauses

In today's class, we'll introduce how to use both the indicative and the subjunctive in clauses expressing ideas about time.

Please review the material we worked on in class last time on [the formation of the perfect and pluperfect subjunctive](../subjunctive2/).  Try the following exercise.  If you are unsure about any of your answers, bring questions to class!

## Exercise

Identify the tense and voice of the highlighted subjunctive form.  If the form is perfect passive or pluperfect passive, identify the gender of the subject as well.

Once you have a correct answer, break the form down:

- what principal part is it built on?  
- what is the stem?
- what is the subjunctive ending?

**Example**:  given ***<span class="highlight">amet</span>***, you correctly identify it as **present active**. Analysis:

- second principle part (*amƒÅre*)
- stem *am-*
- ending *-et*

Practice with the randomly selected forms below until you can confidently step through ten in a row.
