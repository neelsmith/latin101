Cydippe sent the oxen into the fields, but they did not return with her sons.

they yoked themselves to a wagon. sub iugo se iunxerunt



They pulled the wagon for many hours.
Cydippe prayed to the gods, and they granted to her sons the best gift possible for mortals.


That night, they fell asleep and never woke up.fessi somno acquieuerunt.  They were dead.




Cydippe sacerdos Iunonis Argiuae cum boues in pastionem misisset neque ad horam qua sacra in monte ad templum Iunonis duci et fieri deberent apparerent et essent mortui, quae nisi ad horam sacra facta essent, sacerdos interficiebatur;




inter quam trepidationem Cleops et Bitias pro bubus sub iugo se iunxerunt 

et ad fanum sacra et matrem Cydippen in plaustro duxerunt; 

sacrificio-que peracto Cydippe precata est Iunonem, si sacra eius caste coluisset, si filii aduersus eam pii fuissent, ut quicquid bonum mortalibus posset contingere, id filiis eius contingeret.
