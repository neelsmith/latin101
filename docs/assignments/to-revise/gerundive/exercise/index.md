# The gerundive: self-correcting exercise


## Vocabulary

In addition to the required vocabulary for Units 1 and 2:

- *Graecia, Graeciae*, feminine: "Greece"
- *infans, infantis*, masculine: "infant"
- *nutrix, nutricis*, feminine: "nurse"


In the following sentences, as with any Latin sentence,

- find the subject (if expressed) and verb
- identify the type of sentence
- find any direct objects (for transitive-active sentences), agent (for transitive-passive sentences) or predicate (for linking sentences)

Each of these sentences includes a gerundive to express *purpose*.  


1. `79a` Hercules ad canem ducendum venit.
2.  `88a` Atreus mittit Agamemnonem et Menelaum filios ad quaerendum Thyestem.
3.  `98a` Ulixes cum Diomede ad Iphigeniam missus est adducendam.
4. `172a` cum Graeciae ducibus ad eum expugnandum venit.
5. `186a` Metapontus venit ad Dianam Metapontinam ad sacrum faciendum.
6. `187a` infantem nutrici dedit exponendum.
7. `220_218.2` nomen patris ei dandum est.



## Submitting your exercise


For each sentence, answer the following four questions:

-  a. what is the verb of the sentence?
-  b. what is the gerundive?
-  c. what noun or pronoun does the gerundive modify?
-  d. what is the form of gerundive (gender, case and number) ?

You can test yourself using [this interactive page](https://observablehq.com/@neelsmith/lingua-latina-legenda-unit-2-analyze-sentences-using-the-ge?collection=@neelsmith/l3)

When you want to submit your work, create a new file in your github repository named `gerundive1.md` with contents formatted as follows:


- only one answer per line
- number each answer with the sentence number, and the letter for each question, followed by a period


For example, if the homework sentence was:

1. Carthago delenda est.

You could enter the following answers:

> 1a. est
>
> 1b. delenda
>
> 1c. Carthago
>
> 1d. feminine nominative singular
