# Module 1, portfolio assignment: composition

## Background

Prometheus was a Titan, who stole fire from the gods and gifted it to humankind. Incensed, Jupiter condemned him to a horrible punishment - he was chained to a rock where his heart was pecked on by an eagle (and regenerated nightly so the eagle could eat again the next day) until Hercules came along and killed it.
