## Written assignment

Create a file in your repository named `hw4.md`.  Copy these questions into your file, and supply the correct response.


1. What are the three genders of Latin nouns?
1. What are the three pieces of information in a Latin dictionary entry for a noun?
1. How do you figure out what *declension* a noun belongs to?
1. Like Latin, you can easily describe one noun with another noun in English (e.g., "the book's title", "the format of the assignment").  What case do you use in Latin to describe one noun with another noun?
1. What case does Latin use to name the subject of a verb?

Use these dictionary entries to answer the following questions:

- *amor, amoris* m: "love"
- *canis, canis* m or f: "dog"
- *deus, dei* m: god
- *filius, filii* m: son
- *Deianira, Deianirae* f: "Deianira" (a wife or Hercules)
- *Hercules, Herculis* m: "Hercules"
- *nomen, nominis* n: "name"

Each of the following phrases comprises one noun in the nominative case described by a noun in the genitive case.  Identify the gender, case and number of each noun.


1. amor Deianirae
1. deus amoris
1. amor deorum
1. Herculis canis
2. nomen dei
1. filii deorum
1. nomina filiorum

Translate the first noun phrase, *amor Deianirae*, into English.  What are two different meanings that the phrase could have?
