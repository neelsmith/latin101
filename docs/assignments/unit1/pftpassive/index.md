## The perfect passive


- memorize the principal parts of the verbs in the [Unit 1 vocabulary](../vocab1/) list.  The only long vowel marks you need to memorize are in the **second principal part**: you must distinguish between *second conjugation* ending in *-ēre* and *third conjugation* ending in *-ĕre*.
- in your textbook, read "[The perfect passive](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/topics/unit1/perfectpassive/)"



### Written assignment

In your github repository, create a file named `hw2.md`.

For each verb **highlighted like this** in the following English sentences, compose a Latin verb in the perfect tense to express the same idea.  You'll to choose the appropriate voice (active or passive), and create the correct form for the subject of the verb (singular or plural; if passive, also agreeing in gender in the endings of the fourth principal part).

For each sentence, please copy the entire English into your homework, and add the appropriate Latin verb next to it.  For example, if the English sentence was

> 1. The Greeks **came** to Troy.

You would enter in your homework

> 1. The Greeks **came** to Troy. **uenerunt**

*uenerunt* is perfect active, because the subject (the Greeks) performed the action; it is plural to agree with the  plural subject.

1. Hercules **loved** Deianira.
2. Deianira **was loved** by Hercules.
1. Juno **sent** serpents to kill Hercules.
1. The lion of Nemea **was killed** by Hercules. (Lion is masculine in Latin.)
1. Apollo **was given** into slavery to Admetus, king of Thessaly.
1. Messengers **were sent**.
2. The daughters **were given** in marriage
1. To escape the flood, Deucalion and Pyrrha **fled** to the mountains.
1. When no oxen were available, Cleops and  Bitias **led** their mother Cydippa to the festival by yoking themselves to the oxcart.
