### Grammar and Analysis

(1) In the passage you have copied into your file, highlight finite verbs, subjects and direct objects using the following markdown conventions:

- surround finite verbs with two asterisks on either side of the verb to highlight it **like this**
- surround subjects with one asterisk on either side of the subject to highlight it *like this*
- surround direct objects with a backtick on either side to highlight it `like this`

Copy the following questions into your file, and answer them:

(2) To what declension does Antaeum belong to?

(3) What case is *terrae* and what other noun is it working with?

(4) What is the antecedent of *hic*?

(5) What case is *armis*?

(6) Explain the construction  *cum eo*?

(7) Fully identify the form of *fulmen*.  What function is it playing in the sentence? What type of sentence structure do we find in this sentence?

(8) Fully identify the form of *apposita est*.

(9) What is the antecedent of  *eam*?
