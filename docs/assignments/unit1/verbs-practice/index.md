## Practice with verbs


Review your textbook sections on:

1. the [perfect active](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/topics/unit1/perfectactive/)
2. the [perfect passive](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/topics/unit1/perfectpassive/)
3. the [imperfect active and passive](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/topics/unit1/imperfect/)


In class, we will practice using these two very common tenses for narrating events in the class. Bring any questions from your review to class.

There is no written assignment for today's class: this is a good opportunity to catch up on any corrections or revisions you want to make to the first two written assignments.
