# Module 2, portfolio assignment: composition


## Background

Cydippe was a priestess of Juno.  On the occasion of an important festival, the oxen she expected to pull her cart to the sanctuary were not back from the fields in time, so her two sons, named Cleops and Bitias in Hyginus, yoked themselves to the wagon and pulled her.  In gratitude for their great feat, she prayed that they would be granted the best thing possible for mortals.  They then fell peacefully asleep -- and never woke up.  

(This story is known from multiple sources.  Hyginus' version adds the additional drama that if the priestess failed to show up on time for the festival, she would be killed!)




## Instructions 


Supplement your required vocabulary with the following list, and compose a paragraph of Latin about Cydippe and her two sons.

- *acquiesco, acquiescere, acquieui, acquietus* "to rest"
- *adsum, adesse, adfui, -* "to be present"
- *bos, bouis*, m., "ox"
-  **debeo, debere, debui, debitus* "owe, ought"; use with infinitive to *mean "should, ought (do something)"
- *fanum, fani* n. "sanctuary, temple*
- *fessus, fessa, fessum* "exhausted"
- *iugum, iugi* n., "yoke"
- *iungo, iungere, iunxi, iunctus* "join, connect; harness"
- *morior, mori, -, mortuus* "to die"
- *mortalis, mortale* (adj.) "mortal"
- *numquam* "never"
- *optimus, optima, optimum* "best"
- *plaustrum, plaustri* n. "wagon"
- *precor, precari, -, precatus* "to pray"
- *quam* "than"
- **sacerdos, sacerdotis* m. or f., "priest, priestess"
- *sacer, sacra, sacrum*, "sacred"; use the neuter plural "sacred things" with *duco* to mean "perform the sacred ceremonies"
- *surgo, surgere, surrexi, surrectus* "rise (from sleep)"
- **templum, templi* n. "temple"

You should use each vocabulary item in the list at least once.



# Cleops et Bitias, Cydippae filii. 

Your first sentence should express that Cydippe sent the oxen into the fields, but they (the oxen) did not return in time.  Use the preposition *ad* with *tempus, temporis* n. to express "in time."

Your next sentence should express that the rituals were supposed to be performed at that time, and the priestess was supposed to be present at the temple, but Cydippe was not able to set out on the journey.  You can use a distinctive Latin idiom to express the idea of "setting out on a journey":  literally, the phrase means "give yourself over to travel", and uses verb *do* with the reflexive pronouns and the prepositional phrase *in uiam*.

Next, express that Cleops and Bitias wanted to bring their mother to the temple, so they yoked harnessed themselves to a wagon. Latin says this as "They harnessed themselves beneath the yoke."

Next, tell us that they pulled their mother Cydippe in the wagon for many hours.  Cydippe is a Greek name: use *Cydippen* for her accusative singular form.

Your next sentence should express that on account of this great deed, Cydippe prayed to the gods.

Next, relate that that night, the exhausted sons rested, and never awoke.

Finally, express the conclusion that Hyginus attributes to Cydippe: "To die is the best gift for mortals."  Use an infinitive as the subject of the sentence (just like the English phrase, "To die is...").
