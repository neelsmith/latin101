# Practice with pronouns


Review these three nouns as models of the first, second and third declensions:

1. *filia, filiae* f., "daughter"
2. *filius, filii* m., "son"
3. *pater, patris* m., "father"

Make sure that when you come to class today, you can confidently:


- identify any form of any of the three
- produce a give person and number of any of the three
