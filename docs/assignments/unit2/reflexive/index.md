# Reflexive Pronouns

When a pronoun *not* in  the nominative case refers back to the subject of the sentence, we call this a *reflexive pronoun* (from the Latin verb *reflecto* “to turn back”). In English, reflexive pronouns are usually expressed with the suffix "-self" or "-selves." For example, in the English sentence "She loved her," *her* refers to someone other than the subject of the sentence. The subject and the direct object are different people.  But in the sentence "She loved *herself*," *herself* refers to the same person as the subject.  The subject (which would in the nominative case in Latin) and the direct object (which would be in the accusative case in Latin) refer to the same person.

Just as English uses a separate pronoun "herself," Latin has a separate pronoun we use when the person is the same as the subject of the sentence.  Its forms are identical in singular and plural, and are summarized here: 





| Case | 	Sing./Pl. |
| --- | --- |
| Nominative | 	— |
| Genitive | 	suī |
| Dative | 	sibi |
| Accusative | 	sē |
| Ablative | 	sē |



Compare these Latin sentences:

- Amabat eam. (“She loved her.”) *eam* refers to someone who is *not* the subject of the sentence.
- Amabat sē. (“She loved herself.”) *se* is reflexive: it refers to the subject of the sentence
- Donum eī dedit. (“He gave a gift to him.”) *ei* refers to someone who is *not* the subject of the sentence.
- Donum sibi dedit. (“He gave a gift to himself.”)  *sibi* is reflexive:  it refers to the same person as the subject (not explicitly expressed here)


Although it might at first glance seem confusing that the same forms are used for both singular and plural, there is no ambiguity in a complete sentence.  That's because the reflexive pronoun always refers to the same person(s) as the subject, and you always know from the verb form whether the subject is singular or plural.

- Amat sē. (“She loves herself,” or "He loves himself").  *se* must be singular
- Amant sē. (“They love themselves.”) *se* can only be plural because it refers to the subject of a plural verb.
