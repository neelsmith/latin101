# Temporal clauses

- Read this background on [dependent clauses](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/2021-2022/08-temporal-clauses/#dependent-clauses); read through the section on *temporal clauses*, but don't worry yet about the forms of the *subjunctive mood*


Concepts to focus on:

- *dependent* vs. *independent* clauses
- *temporal* clauses, emphasizing:
    1. time
    2. circumstance
