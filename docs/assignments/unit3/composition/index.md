# Composition

## Instructions

Supplement your vocabulary with the following list, and compose a paragraph of Latin about the story of the Trojan horse.

- *ab + eo*. The compound narrows the idea of “to go” to mean “go away.”
- *abscondo, abscondĕre, abscondidi, absconditus* “conceal, hide”
- *Achiuus, Achiuva, Achiuum* “Achaean” (a Homeric name for the Greeks)
- *cognosco, cognoscĕre, cognoui, cognitus* “to perceive, learn, understand”
- *credo, credĕre, credidi, creditus* “to believe”. Use the dative case for "trust in, believe (a person)".
- equus, equi, m. “horse”
- *dico, dicĕre, dixi, dictus* “to say”
- *ex + eo*. The compound narrows the idea of “to go” to mean “to go out” or “exit” (which dervies directly from Latin exeo).
- *in + sum*. The compound narrows the idea of “to be” to mean “to be inside”. The principal parts are identical to those of sum
- *ligneus, lignea, ligneum* “wooden”
- *nemo* nominative singular, “no one”
- *potior, potiri, -, potitus* "take possession of"
- *scribo, scribere, scripsi, scriptus* "to write"
