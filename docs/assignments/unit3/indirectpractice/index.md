# Practice with indirect statement

In your textbook, read an introduction to [indirect statement](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/2021-2022/06-indirect-statement/#indirect-statement).

Use the following vocabulary notes to express the following ideas in Latin.

- *ab* + *eo*.  The compound narrows the idea of "to go" to mean "go away."
- *abscondo, abscondĕre, abscondidi, absconditus* "conceal, hide"
- *Achiuus, Achiuva, Achiuum* "Achaean" (a Homeric name for the Greeks)
- *cognosco, cognoscĕre, cognoui, cognitus* "to perceive, learn, understand"
- *credo, credĕre, credidi, creditus* "to believe"
- *dico, dicĕre, dixi, dictus* "to say"
- *equus, equi*, m. "horse"
- *ex* + *eo*. The compound narrows the idea of "to go" to mean "to go out" or "exit" (which dervies directly from Latin *exeo*).
- *in* + *sum*. The compound narrows the idea of "to be" to mean "to be inside".  The principal parts are identical to those of *sum*
- *ligneus, lignea, ligneum* "wooden"
- *nemo* nominative singular, "no one"
