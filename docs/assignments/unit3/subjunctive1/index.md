# The imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive


## Formation of the imperfect subjunctive

To form the imperfect subjunctive, we will take the *entire* second principal part and then simply add our regular active or passive personal endings directly onto it.

Take a look at the following examples of the imperfect subjunctive in the third singular active and passive (respectively):

- amō, amāre, amāvī, amātus > amāret, amārētur
- moneō, monēre, monuī, monitus > monēret, monērētur
- regō, regere, rexī, rectus > regeret, regerētur
- capiō, capere, cēpī, captus > caperet, caperētur
- audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītus > audīret, audīrētur

Remember the irregular second principal part of the verb *sum* ("to be"): *esse*.  Its third 

- sum, esse, fui, - > esset (no passive voice)


## Formation of the pluperfect subjunctive

### Active voice

As always, we use the third principal part to create forms in the active voice of the perfect system.

First, after dropping the ending *-i*, expand the stem for the pluperfect subject by adding *-isse-*, then use the regular active voice endings.



- amō, amāre, amāuī, amātus > amauisse-t
- moneō, monēre, monuī, monitus > monuisse-t
- regō, regere, rexī, rectus > rexisse-t
- capiō, capere, cēpī, captus > cepisse-t
- audiō, audīre, audīuī, audītus > audiuisse-t
- sum, esse, fui, - > fuisse-t




### Passive voice

As in the indicative mood, passive forms use the fourth principal part together with a form of the verb "to be."

To form the perfect passive indicative, we used a present indicative form of *sum*, for example *Moniti sunt* "They were warned." To form the pluperfect passive subjunctive, we use the fourth principal part with the *impefect subjunctive*, like these examples:



- amō, amāre, amāuī, amātus > amatus esset
- moneō, monēre, monuī, monitus > monitus esset
- regō, regere, rexī, rectus > rectus esset
- capiō, capere, cēpī, captus > captus esset
- audiō, audīre, audīuī, audītus > auditus esset
