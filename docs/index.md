## Week at a glance


- Week of **Oct. 26-30**: Questions, including deliberative questions with the subjunctive.
- **New forms**:  pay attention to how the stem vowel changes from indicative to subjunctive in this comparison of third-singular active forms of the present tense. Color key:
    - (second principal part) vowel identifying <span class="infinitive">which conjugation the verb belongs to</span>
    - stem vowel used <span class="indicative">only in indicative</span>
    - stem vowel used <span class="subjunctive">only in subjunctive</span>
    - *warning!*  stem vowel used <span class="warn">in either subjunctive or indicative</span>, depending on the conjugation
