# Course requirements and grading

Course grades will be determined by specification grading, a system that makes criteria for earning course points explicit, and gives you control over your grades.

Individual assignments are graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale according to a previously shared rubric. If you complete all the specified requirements for the assignment, your grade is satifactory and you receive the full number of points for that assignment.  If you do complete one or more of the requirements, your grade is unsatisfactory, and you recieve no points.  Within each of the three major units of the course, you may repeat assignments as often as you like until the final deadline for sumbitting material for that unit.

You can earn a maximum of 100 points for your course work in the fall semester.  Your course grade is determined by your satisfactory completion of the course requirements listed here.
