# Course resources and reference materials

- guide to [standard American pronounciation of Latin](./pronounciation/)

## *Lingua Latina Legenda* project (L3)

- online [textbook and reference materials](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/).  The L3 textbook is the basic reference and textbook we will use this year.
- a [guide to the L3 youtube channel](https://lingualatina.github.io/courses/youtube/) (or go to the [channel directly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyA2aidE3BiD3idsxrJr5Hg)). The L3 youtube channel includes short videos introducing content covered in the online textbook.


## Latin 101, section 1

- a guide to [short videos specific to our section](./videos/) (or go straight to a [youtube playlist for our section](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUcfS6VHaxZDWuU6b7cz9fWV2S6UmH7Yy)). I will post *very* short videos on topics specific to our section of Latin 101 on this channel.
- [slides](/slides/).  I will share any slides we use in class meetings here.


## Reference material on other sites

As you advance in Latin and read increasingly complex material, you will learn how to use a good  lexicon and a reference grammar. Two standard scholarly resources you should be aware of (even if you don't use them much before Latin 102) are:

- from Furman University, an online version of Lewis and Short's *Latin Dictionary* including searching both Latin terms and English definitions: [Lewis-Short](http://folio2.furman.edu/lewis-short/index.html)
- from Dickinson College, an online version of *Allen and Greenoughâ€™s New Latin Grammar for Schools and Colleges*:  [Allen and Greenough](http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/credits-and-reuse)
