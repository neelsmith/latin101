# Pronouncing Latin


## Alphabet

- no *W*
- *K*, *Y*, *Z* rare (mostly in Greek borrowings)
- original *I*, *U* can be vowels or consonants, later spelled separately as vocalic *I*, *U*, consonantal *J*, *V*

## Consonants

Pronounciation of consonants is consisent with English.  Note that:

- *C*, *G* always "hard"
- *QU* = "kw"


## Vowels

- *A*, *E*, *I*, *O*, *U* are pure vowels similar to Spanish or Italian

## Diphthongs

*Diphthongs* are a single vowel sound produced by combining two vowel sounds.  Pronounce them as though you were running together the individual vowels.

- *AE* like Ä« in English. *hae*, "these" (feminine), sounds like "high"
- *AU* like short ow in English. *causa*, "reason, cause," sounds like "cow-sa"
- *EI*  like "ay" in English. *rei*, "matter, thing," sounds like "ray"
- *OE* like "oy" in English. *coepit*, "h/she began," sounds like "koy-pit"
