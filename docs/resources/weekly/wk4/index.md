## Week at a glance: Sept. 19-25

This week we complete our introduction to nouns.  We learn the following constructions:

- expressing the agent of passive verbs using *ab* + the *ablative* case
- direct objects using the *accusative* case
- indirect objects using the *dative* case

This will be the last new grammar we introduce in Unit 1.

## Due dates

Daily assignments: Sept. 21, direct and indirect objects.
