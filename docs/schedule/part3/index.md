# Unit 3: subordination

## Background

In Unit 1, you learned how Latin nouns, adjectives and verbs change form.  In Unit 2, you learned how to use the verbal noun (the *gerund*) and verbal adjective (the *gerundive*) to express purpose, and extended your knowledge of Latin tenses to present time.

In Unit 3 you will be introduced to *subordinate* (or *dependent*) clauses: clauses with a subject and verb that can not stand on their own. You will learn how Latin expresses *reported* or *indirect* statements.



## Goals

You will read longer selections of Latin including subordinate clauses using the subjunctive mood, and speech reported in indirect statement.  You will be able to translate in the active voice in English ideas expressed in Latin with *deponent* verbs, that is, verbs in the passive voice that express active ideas. You will become comfortable using some very common irregular verbs.


## Objectives


- identify all forms of the present, imperfect, perfect and pluperfect subjunctive
- identify the perfect active and passive infinitive
- convert statements to corresponding questions
- use the subjunctive mood to ask deliberative questions
- identify indirect statements and correctly translate the time relation indicated by the tense of the infinitive
- identify temporal clauses in the subjunctive and correctly translate the time relation indicated by the tense of the verb
