# Community-based learning

Community-based learning (CBL) is an essential part of our course.  We are privileged to be be able to study Greek together in our MWF class meetings.  In your CBL work, you will share some of that experience with others. Community-based learning helps us to understand our language study in a broader context. The active engagement it requires also will improve your development of the language skills required for your study of Greek.

Your CBL work will include a weekly CBL section meeting on campus, and a small-group project that will include work in the community.

In the fall semester of 2022, our community partner will be the Worcester Art Museum.
