# Course goals and objectives



## Goals

During this two-semester sequence, you will learn to read unaltered Latin texts, focusing especially on the mythological handbook of Hyginus, the *Fabulae*. You will explain how myths convey values, and serve as both entertainment and a way to explore difficult questions.  

You will compare how Latin texts use language to organize a view of the world with how our use of English today.

You will articulate how the study of texts in Latin has shaped structures of power, and how people continue to use Latin to make claims to authority or privilege.

## Objectives

You can see a more detailed breakdown of concrete objectives in the [introduction to each of the three major units of the course](http://localhost:4000/schedule/), as well as in the introductions to individual assignments. In summary, you will:


- recognize and identify core vocabulary and all inflectional forms in a real Latin text
- read extended passages of real Latin texts with minimal glossing
- read aloud and pronounce Latin with confidence and accuracy
- analyze syntax and sentence structure in both Latin and English
- translate complex ideas and sentences into Latin and English
